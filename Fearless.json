"There's somethin' bout the way\nThe street looks when it's just rained\nThere's a glow off the pavement\nYou walk me to the car\nAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\nIn the middle of the parking lot\nYeah\nOh, yeah\n\nWe're drivin' down the road\nI wonder if you know\nI'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now\nBut you're just so cool\nRun your hands through your hair\nAbsent mindedly makin' me want you\n\nAnd I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why\nBut with you I'd dance in a storm\nIn my best dress\nFearless\n\nSo baby drive slow\n'Til we run out of road in this one horse town\nI wanna stay right here in this passenger seat\nYou put your eyes on me\nIn this moment now capture it, remember it\n\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why\nBut with you I'd dance in a storm\nIn my best dress\nFearless\nOh, oh\n\nWell you stood there with me in the doorway\nMy hands shake\nI'm not usually this way but\nYou pull me in and I'm a little more brave\nIt's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless\n\nOh, yeah\n\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why\nBut with you I'd dance in a storm\nIn my best dress\nFearless\n\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why\nBut with you I'd dance in a storm\nIn my best dress\nFearless\nOh, oh, oh yeah"
