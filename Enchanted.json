"There I was again tonight\nForcing laughter, faking smiles\nSame old tired, lonely place\nWalls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy\nVanished when I saw your face\nAll I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you\n\nYour eyes whispered, \"Have we met?\"\n'Cross the room your silhouette\nStarts to make its way to me\nThe playful conversation starts\nCounter all your quick remarks\nLike passing notes in secrecy\n\nAnd it was enchanting to meet you\nAll I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you\n\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nThe lingering question kept me up\n2 AM, who do you love?\nI wonder 'til I'm wide awake\nAnd now I'm pacing back and forth\nWishing you were at my door\nI'd open up and you would say, \"Hey\"\n\nIt was enchanting to meet you\nAll I know is, I was enchanted to meet you\n\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nThat this night is flawless, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nThis is me praying that\nThis was the very first page\nNot where the story line ends\nMy thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again\nThese are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon\nI was enchanted to meet you\nPlease don't be in love with someone else\nPlease don't have somebody waiting on you\nPlease don't be in love with someone else\nPlease don't have somebody waiting on you\n\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nThis night is flawless, don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\nI'll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nPlease don't be in love with someone else\nPlease don't have somebody waiting on you"
